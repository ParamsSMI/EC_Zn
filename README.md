# On the Classification of Weierstrass Elliptic Curves over Z<sub>n</sub>
 

This GitHub repository includes source code that is used to generate computational results on the classification of Weierstrass elliptic curves over Z<sub>n</sub>. It includes C++ codes for the following:  
- Classification of generalized Weierstrass elliptic curves over Z<sub>n</sub> 
- Classification of reduced Weierstrass elliptic curves over Z<sub>n</sub> 
- Classification of Weierstrass elliptic curves over Z<sub>2</sub> and Z<sub>3</sub>
- Data Analysis for conjecture "The number of nonsingular reduced Weierstrass elliptic curves over Z<sub>p<sup>m</sup></sub> is Phi(p<sup>2m</sup>)" 
- Data Analysis for quadratic residues (QRs) and cubic residues(CRs) over Z<sub>p<sup>m</sup></sub>

- Research in our lab currently focuses on two aspects of information processing viz. deciphering the information processing principles in life (systems biology) and building a computer out of bio-molecules (synthetic biology). 
- The key expertise of the lab is in error-correcting codes. We also work in classical and quantum information processing principles with expertise in coding theory and its wide variety of applications in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). 
- Our research areas includes mathematics and its elegant applications in Emerging Technologies: DNA digital data storage, DNA computing, chemical computing, coding theory, quantum computing, quantum machine learning, quantum error correction, cryptography, quantum algorithms, synthetic biology, DNA nanotechnology and bioinformatics.
